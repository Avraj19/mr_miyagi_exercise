Prompt the user for input, evaluate each input and print the appropriate responses.

    --> 'questions are wise, but for now. Wax on, and Wax off!'
- Every statement/question must start with Sensei, otherwise:
    --> 'You are smart, but not wise - address me as Sensei please'
- Every time you mention 'block' or 'blocking' --> Mr. Miyagi responde with
    --> 'Remember, best block, not to be there..'
- Anything else you say:
    --> 'do not lose focus. Wax on. Wax off.'
- Make it so you keep playing until we say: 'Sensei, I am at peace'
    --> 'Sometimes, what heart know, head forget'
